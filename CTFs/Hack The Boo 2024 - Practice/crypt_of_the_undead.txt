CryptOfTheUndead
All my important files have been zombified by the notorious Zombie Cybercrime Gang. Can you lay them to rest and bring my files back?

Checking the filetypes of these files, one is a ELF file, the other is a data file. Not sure..
Poking around in the ELF file with commands I find this:

readelf -p 16 crypt

String dump of section '.rodata':
  [     4]  crypt
  [     a]  Usage: %s file_to_encrypt\n
  [    25]  .undead
  [    2d]  error reading file
  [    40]  error renaming file
  [    54]  error opening new file
  [    6b]  chacha.c
  [    74]  0 != counter[1]
  [    88]  error: that which is undead may not be encrypted
  [    c0]  BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINS!!
  [    e8]  successfully zombified your file!
  [   110]  chacha20_block_next
  [   130]  expand 32-byte k

Telling me that the other file is a chacha20 encrypted file with a 32-bit counter.
Key?? BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAINS!!
