sekur julius
Hidden deep in the forest was an ancient scroll, rumored to grant immense power to anyone who could read its shifting symbols. On Halloween, a curious traveler found the scroll, its letters strangely out of order. As they deciphered the message, the words slowly rearranged themselves, revealing a dark spell. But with the final shift, the traveler felt a cold presence behind them, whispering, "You were never meant to understand." The forest grew silent, but the spell was already cast.

Since this is a crypto challenge and named julius, i'm already thinking that this is a ceasar cipher C:
The Ceasar Cipher is a substitution cipher, which changes one character to another.
Downloading the content of the CTF flag, and there it is, the beautiful Python code with encrypt and decrypt functions.
Now notice the key is a random number between 1, 1337.
So we gotta find the key to decrypt the message.

Code:
def cesars_chipher(string: str, shift: int = 3) -> str:
    abc = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.upper()
    return "".join([abc[(abc.find(c) + shift) % 26] for c in string])

s = 'LTARDBT0ID0WPRZIWTQDD0ILDIWDJHPCSILTCINUDJG!0IWXH0XH0P0EGDDU0DU0RDCRTEI0ID0EGDKT0NDJ0IWPI0IWT0RPTHPG0RXEWTG0XH0XCHTRJGT0CD0BPIITG0WDL0BPCN0IXBTH0NDJ0PEEAN0XI.0IWT0HTRJGXIN0DU0P0IWDJHPCS0SXHIXCRI0HWXUIH0XH0TKTCIJPAAN0IWT0HPBT0PH0IWPI0DU0P0HXCVAT0HWXUI.0TCDJVW0BJBQAXCV,0IPZT0NDJG0UAPV0PCS0TCYDN0IWT0GTHI0DU0IWT0RDCITHI.0BPZT0HJGT0NDJ0LGPE0IWT0UDAADLXCV0ITMI0LXIW0IWT0WIQ0UAPV0UDGBPI0HTRJGXINDUPIWDJHPCSDGHTRJGXINDUPHXCVAT.'

for decrypt_key in range(1,1337):
    decrypted_text = cesars_chipher(s, decrypt_key)
    if 'HTB' in decrypted_text :
        decrypted_text = decrypted_text.replace('K', ' ')
        with open('decrypted_text.txt', 'w') as f:
            f.write(decrypted_text)

s variable is the string with the encrypted message, now i wrap my function in a for loop, to find the key
After i've found the key, i scroll around the output file, and see that there are HTB within the text.
I make a control statement, that if the decrypted message has HTB within it, then 
I should replace the 'K' within that string with space. 
You will see this is you debug ur code while coding or you can use print() to see what your current decrypted message is
And then i just write the decrypted message to a file, read from it, and at the end i find the flag
