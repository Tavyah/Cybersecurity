We're breaking into the catacombs to find a rumoured great treasure - I hope there's no vengeful spirits down there...


First thing i do is check what filetype this is, by using an online tool to identify filetypes.
It tells me that it is a ELF file, which i have never come across before, so a quick googling and I find that
I can use a tool called readelf in my linux virtual machine

So now i'm just looking at the manual of readelf, trying to just display info, take a look what i see and you know, dig around :p
I read on stackoverflow that constant strings are stored in .rodata (obv i'm googling this), so i figure out how to read the .rodata
By using the command: readelf -S robber
I can see the different sections, now .rodata is one of the sections and to access it, i'll use the flag -p which stands for string-dump
So what I am trying to do is display the strings of .rodata
I use the command: readelf -p 16 robber
The .rodata has the section number 16

The dump i get from .rodata
String dump of section '.rodata':
  [     8]  We took a wrong turning!
  [    28]  We found the treasure! (I hope it's not cursed)

Since i am not familiar with ELF files, i just take a guess and see if i get anything from section 28 since I am thinking that maybe since the treasure is there.
It's a wrong turn.. xD so now i just take another look at the different sections and see a section named .data
I dump the .data strings which is section number 24 and... voila!

The dump from the section .data

$ readelf -p 24 robber

String dump of section '.data':
