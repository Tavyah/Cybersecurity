Scholars who dared to unlock its secrets would first exchange a series of encrypted symbols, forming a bond no one could break. As they secured their connection, layers of protection wrapped around them like invisible chains. But as the final cipher was set, a chilling realization struckâ€”the connection they forged was now bound to something far darker, something watching from the shadows.
