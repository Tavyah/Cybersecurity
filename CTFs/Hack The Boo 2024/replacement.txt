Replacement

A cursed spell has altered a scroll, changing key letters. Replace the haunted letter with a random one to break the curse!

Task:
Given a string, a letter in the string and a random letter, replace all instances of the first letter with the latter.

Example
Input
Input String: Test me
Replace: e
Replace with: K

Output
TKst mK

This exercise I is pretty straight forward, all you gotta do is take in the inputs
And then replace letters with the replacement letter
There is a string function for this in Python, that allows us to replace letters in a string
replace() function


Code:
# take in the number
n = str(input())
replace = str(input())
replace_with = str(input())

n = n.replace(replace, replace_with)

answer = n
# print answer
print(answer)
