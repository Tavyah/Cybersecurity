MiniMax
In a haunted graveyard, spirits hide among the numbers. Can you identify the smallest and largest among them before they vanish?

Task:
MiniMax
We've intercepted codes from an underground organisation with intentions of malicious activity. Intelligence has informed us that most of the numbers are garbage, but the biggest and smallest numbers in the file form co-ordinates of the group's next attack location.

Identify these 2 numbers, then print out first the minimum and then the maximum. Please be swift, agent - the clock is ticking!

Example
Input
3.29 3.09 1.34 2.89

Output
1.34
3.29

Solution:
First you gotta check what input you have, then since it's a string with multiple decimal values, i split the string on
the spaces betweent he decimals and get a list
Then when i have the list with decimal strings, i typecast it to float with the map function
And then i just print out the min value and max value accordingly.

Code:
# take in the number
n = str(input())
numbers_list = n.split(' ')
numbers_float_list = list(map(float, numbers_list))

print(min(numbers_float_list))
print(max(numbers_float_list))
